To understand and use the pipelines and apps in the `svx-mdi-tools` suite,
you must first understand structural variation (SV) of the genome, and
something about the attributes and limitations of the techniques used to 
detect that variation.

We published a comprehensive overview of the biology of structure genome
variation and the evolution of SV ascertainment technologies, many of
which directly correspond to specific SVX pipelines.

Here, we present a somewhat more practical overview immediately geared
toward helping use the SVX tools.
