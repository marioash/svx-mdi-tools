## {{page.title}}

While all SVs have novel junctions, only a subset change the number of
copies of the affected sequence in the genome. That subset is called 
**Copy Number Variants (CNVs)**. In addition to detecting their junctions,
CVNs can be deteted by a loss or gain of segments of the reference
genome relative to some expectation. 

Further descriptions pending.
