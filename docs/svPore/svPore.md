## {{page.title}}

The svPore pipeline and app analyzes long-read, whole-genome sequencing 
libraries for rare and recurrent structural variants (SV) junctions
relative to a reference genome.

Early pipeline actions support file conversion and offline basecalling of
Oxford Nanopore long-read data.

Later actions support alignment to a reference genome and SV junction
discovery, collation, and inter-molecule comparison. These actions
might reasonably be applied to any long read data, but at present 
have only been applied to nanopore data.
