The [**svx-mdi-tools**](https://github.com/wilsontelab/svx-mdi-tools) 
suite contains pipelines and apps
for genome structural variant (SV) analysis by different library strategies
from the 
[Thomas Wilson laboratory](https://wilsonte-umich.github.io)
at the University of Michigan.

## Available tools

Pipelines and apps in stable release are:
- **svCapture** = find SVs in whole-genome capture sequencing

Pipelines and apps in beta are:
- **svWGS** = find SVs in whole-genome sequencing data (without capture)
- **scCNV** = find SVs in single-cell whole-genome amplification sequencing
- **svAmplicon** = find SVs in targeted amplicon sequences

## Installation

Please see the [svx-mdi-tools GitHub site](https://wilsontelab.github.io/svx-mdi-tools) for detailed information on how to install the svx-mdi-tools suite
on your HPC server to run Stage 1 pipelines.

Please see the [MDI Desktop App](https://midataint.github.io/mdi-desktop-app) for detailed information on how to install and access the web server for running
interactive Stage 2 apps for data visualization.
