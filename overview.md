This **svx-mdi-tools** repository contains pipelines and apps
for genome structural variant (SV) analysis by different library strategies
from the 
[Thomas Wilson laboratory](https://wilsonte-umich.github.io)
at the University of Michigan.

## Available tools

Pipelines and apps in stable release are:
- **svCapture** = find SVs in whole-genome capture sequencing

Pipelines and apps in beta are:
- **svWGS** = find SVs in whole-genome sequencing data (without capture)
- **scCNV** = find CNVs in single-cell whole-genome amplification sequencing
- **svAmplicon** = find SVs in targeted amplicon sequences
