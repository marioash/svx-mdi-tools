# rep=  
# 3 = 24/LK-13, ~85%S, XX
# 70 = 69/LK-74, mid-S, X Y + aneuploidy
# 37 = 32/LK-44, ?40%S, XY
# 8 = 79/LK-18, ~15%S, XX
# un = 
# 90 = 91/LK-92, 0%S, XX + gain chr22
# 81 = 81/LK-84, 0%S, XY + loss chr15

# cell with shaping issues
# 39 = some hit, some miss on wavy "gains"
# 40 = NR_wm_reshaped - something is wrong with shape fit? loses peak? peak moves? FIXED!
# 59 = low coverage, passes, has a problem after shaping (prob.like 40) FIXED!
# 52 = extreme shape on chr16, exaggerates a gain? NO REAL ERROR, JUST THE VAGARIES OF SHAPE FITTING - suppress extreme shapes?

# cells with issues related to fractionS/replicating cell assignments
# 49 = very late replication (got)
# 51 = even later replication?? (missed)
# 93 = likely a miss of a late-replicating cell due to waviness, stays squashed
# 95 = possible very late replication, missed

# cells with replication segments misassignments (CN1_NAR1 instead of CN2_NAR0, etc.)
# others above
# 82 = late replicating with chr22+, some replication miscalls

# other miscellaneous cells
# 47 = very high res unreplicated
# 56 = small chr19 segmental, is it real?
# 83 = early replication with chr22+, nailed it
# 84 = similer to 83, somewhat later in S
# 86 = unreplicated (low res) partner to 83/84 (also 89, 90)
# 91 = low res, maybe early replicating, but it just gets squashed (note chr17, chr22), chr22+ still detectable
