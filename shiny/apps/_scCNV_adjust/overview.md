The scCNV_adjust app allows users to manually inspect
single cell data in the scCNV pipeline in order to make
adjustments to, or reject, unusual cells. 

Its main purpose is to help identify cells with patterns
that are difficult to discern algorthmically but that 
are easily identified by a trained eye, most importantly
replicating cells.

Additionally, some doublet cells may still be desirable
to keep after changing the modal autosomal copy number
to 4 instead of 2.
