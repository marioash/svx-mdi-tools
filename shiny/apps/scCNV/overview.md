The scCNV app allows users to manually inspect and explore
single-cell, whole-genome data from the scCNV pipeline to
make adjustments to, or reject, input cells and to make
and track CNV calls.

The pipeline and app simultaneously track the replication
state of cells. CNV calls take replication into account,
and app features allow one to examine replication timing
maps throughout the genome.
