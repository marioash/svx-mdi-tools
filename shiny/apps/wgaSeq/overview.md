Whole Genome Amplification (WGA) of single cells by techniques such as MALBAC
and others allows DNA sequencing of individual cells or only a few cells.                    

The wgaSeq app examines such cells for large
copy number alterations such as whole chromosome aneuploidies, segmental
gains and losses, or possibly smaller CNVs depending on data quality.

Tools allow you to optimize data normalization and
to reject low quality cells.

The app further helps explore whether observed alterations are unique to a cell
or shared between related cells.
